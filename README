XML::Config - a simple XML Configuration file reader.

Preface:

This is stupendously simple.  Given a well formed configuration file like this:

<Root>
 <A_variable>A Key</A_variable>
</Root>

it returns:

{A_variable => 'A Key'}

I whipped this together for internal use is some of our applications, and it does the trick. 
It will attempt to parse a .bak file in the same directory as the config file you specify if
there is an error. See the manpage for details.   

CHANGES:

0.2 -> Two new options in load_conf(), allows you to pass a hash ref to be
filled by the config reader, instead of the default behaviour of just
passing back a hash.  As a natural extension to this functionality, you
may also pass an array ref to load_conf() containing variable names which
you do not want the config reader to over write if it finds them in the
config file.
