XML::Config - a simple XML Configuration file reader.

Preface:

This is stupendously simple.  Given a well formed configuration file like this:

<Root>
 <A_variable>A Key</A_variable>
</Root>

it returns:

{A_variable => 'A Key'}

I whipped this together for internal use is some of our applications, and it does the trick. 
It will attempt to parse a .bak file in the same directory as the config file you specify if
there is an error. See the manpage for details.
